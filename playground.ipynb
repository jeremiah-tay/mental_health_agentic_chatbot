For example, ask their teacher about your child’s \\nbehavior in school, at daycare, or on the playground. \\nYou can talk with your child’s pediatrician or health care provider and describe your \\nchild’s behavior and what you have observed and learned from talking with others. You \\ncan also ask the health care provider for a referral to a mental health professional with \\nexperience and expertise in evaluating and treating children. Get information about \\nfinding a health care provider or accessing treatment at www.nimh.nih.gov/findhelp. \\nHow is children’s mental health assessed? \\nAn evaluation by a mental health professional can help \\nunderstand and clarify your child’s emotions, behavior, and \\ncurrent situation. Based on this information, the mental \\nhealth professional can decide if your child would benefit \\nfrom an intervention and what intervention might work best. \\nA comprehensive evaluation of a child’s mental health \\nusually involves: \\n● A parent interview to discuss the child’s developmental \\nhistory, temperament, relationships with friends and \\nfamily, medical history, interests, abilities, and any \\nprior treatment\\n● Information gathering from the child’s school, such as \\nstandardized test scores and reports on behavior, \\ncapabilities, and difficulties \\n● If needed, an interview with the child for testing and \\nbehavioral observations\\nAsking questions and providing information to your child’s \\nhealth care provider can improve your child’s care. Talking \\nwith the health care provider builds trust and leads to better \\nresults, quality, safety, and satisfaction with care. \\nHere are some questions you can ask when meeting with \\nprospective treatment providers. \\n● Do you use treatment approaches that are supported\\nby research? \\n● Do you involve parents in the treatment? If so, how are \\nparents involved? \\n● Will there be “homework” between sessions? \\n● How will progress be evaluated? \\n● How soon can we expect to see progress? \\n● How long should treatment last?\\nFor more ideas on how to start a conversation with your child’s \\nhealth care provider, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/talkingtips. \\nHow are childhood mental health disorders treated? \\nThe mental health professional will review the evaluation results \\nto help determine if a child’s emotions and behavior are related \\nto changes or stresses at home or school or if they may \\nindicate a disorder for which they would recommend treatment. \\nThere are several treatment options the mental health \\nprofessional may recommend. \\n● Psychotherapy (sometimes called talk therapy), which \\nincludes many different approaches such as structured \\npsychotherapies directed at specific conditions. For \\nmore information about types of psychotherapies, visit \\nwww.nimh.nih.gov/psychotherapies. Effective \\npsychotherapy for children often incorporates: \\n \\n■Parent involvement in the treatment \\n \\n■Teaching the child skills to practice at home or school \\n(between-session “homework assignments”) \\n \\n■Measures of progress (such as rating scales and \\nimprovements on “homework assignments”) that are \\ntracked over time\\n \\n●Medications, which will depend on the diagnosis \\nand may include antidepressants, stimulants, mood \\nstabilizers, or other medications. For information on \\nspecific classes of medications, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/\\nmedications. Medications are often used in combination \\nwith psychotherapy. If multiple health care providers or \\nspecialists are involved, treatment information should be \\nshared and coordinated between providers to achieve the \\nbest results. \\n● Family counseling, which includes family members to \\nhelp them understand how a child’s challenges may affect \\nrelationships with parents and siblings.\\n● Support for parents, such as individual or group sessions \\nthat include training and the opportunity to talk with \\nother parents. Parental support can provide new \\nstrategies for helping a child manage difficult emotions \\nand behavior in a positive way. The therapist can also \\ncoach parents on how to work with schools to receive \\nclassroom accommodations. \\nFor information about treatment options for specific disorders, \\nvisit the NIMH website at www.nimh.nih.gov/health.'),\n",

Researchers need to vary medications \\nand treatments so they can compare results and \\nlearn from their differences.  \\nWhile a study’s treatment or findings may help \\npatients directly, sometimes participants will \\nreceive no direct benefit.

These attacks are characterized by a sudden wave of fear or discomfort\\nor a sense of losing control even when there is no clear danger or trigger. Not everyone who experiences a panic attack will develop panic\\ndisorder.\\nPanic attacks often include physical symptoms that might feel like a heart attack, such as trembling or tingling in the body or a rapid heart rate.\\nPanic attacks can occur at any time, sometimes even during sleep. Many people with panic disorder worry about the possibility of having another\\nattack and may significantly change their lives to avoid having another attack. Panic attacks can occur as frequently as several times a day or as\\nrarely as a few times a year.\\nPanic disorder often begins in the late teens or early adulthood. Women are more likely than men to develop panic disorder. With the right\\ntreatment and support, people with panic disorder can manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of panic disorder?\\nPeople with panic disorder may have:\\nSudden and repeated panic attacks of overwhelming anxiety and fear\\nA feeling of being out of control\\nA fear of death or impending doom during a panic attack\\nAn intense worry about when the next panic attack will happen\\nA fear or avoidance of places where panic attacks have occurred in the past\\nPhysical symptoms during a panic attack may include:\\nPounding or racing heart\\nSweating\\nChills\\nTrembling\\nDifficulty breathing\\nWeakness or dizziness\\nTingly or numb hands\\nChest pain\\nStomach pain or nausea\\nA panic attack can last from a few minutes to an hour or sometimes longer. While these feelings can be distressing, panic attacks themselves are\\nnot life-threatening, and the physical symptoms usually resolve with time. However, for some, the fear of future attacks may lead to ongoing\\nanxiety.\\nWhat is the difference between a panic attack and panic disorder?\\nA panic attack is a one-time or occasional episode of intense fear with physical and emotional symptoms. An isolated panic attack is not a\\nmental disorder.\\n07/09/2025, 22:20\\nPanic Disorder: What You Need to Know - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms\\n1/4'),\n",

Researchers have\\nfound that several parts of the brain and certain biological processes may play a crucial role in fear and anxiety. Some researchers think panic\\nattacks are like “false alarms,” where our body’s typical survival instincts are active either too often or too strongly, or some combination of the\\ntwo. For example, someone with panic disorder might feel their heart pounding and assume they’re having a heart attack. This may lead to a\\nvicious cycle, causing a person to experience panic attacks seemingly out of the blue, the central feature of panic disorder. In addition,\\nresearchers are looking at the ways stress and environmental factors play a role in the disorder.\\nHow is panic disorder diagnosed?\\nTo be diagnosed with panic disorder, a person must experience recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. They must also spend at least 1 month\\nworrying about having more panic attacks, feeling scared about what the attacks mean, or changing their behavior to try to avoid future attacks.\\nIf you think you’re experiencing symptoms of panic disorder, talk to a health care provider, such as a primary care doctor, psychiatrist,\\npsychologist, or clinical social worker. During the visit, the provider may ask when your symptoms began, how long they have lasted, how often\\nthey occur, and their impact on your life. After discussing your history, the provider may conduct a physical exam to ensure that an unrelated\\nphysical problem is not causing your symptoms.\\nWhat other illnesses can co-occur with panic disorder?\\nSome people with panic disorder have other mental and physical health disorders or conditions, including depression, other anxiety disorders,\\npost-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome, or thyroid problems. Panic disorder is also commonly associated with alcohol and substance misuse.\\nAgoraphobia can sometimes develop as a co-occurring condition of panic disorder. People with agoraphobia have an intense fear or anxiety of\\ncertain places or situations where escape or obtaining help might be difficult or unavailable if they were to experience a panic attack or panic-like\\nsymptoms. Learn more about\\xa0agoraphobia.\\nThe presence of multiple disorders can make treatment more complex, and people with panic disorder and co-occurring mental disorders may\\nbenefit from a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses all aspects of their mental health.\\nHow is panic disorder treated?\\nTreatment for panic disorder typically involves psychotherapy, medication, or both.\\xa0Choosing the right treatment plan is based on a person’s\\nneeds, preferences, and medical situation, as well as consultation with a mental health professional or a health care provider. Finding the best\\ntreatment may take trial and error, and both\\xa0psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work.\\nPsychotherapy\\nPsychotherapy (also called talk therapy or counseling) can be effective when delivered in person or virtually via telehealth. A provider may\\nsupport or supplement therapy using digital or mobile technology, like apps or other tools.\\xa0Different therapies work for different types of people.\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a research-supported type of psychotherapy, is commonly used to treat panic disorder. CBT teaches a person\\ndifferent ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to the feelings that happen during or before a panic attack. The attacks can become less\\nfrequent once a person learns to react differently to the physical sensations of anxiety and fear during a panic attack. CBT has been well studied\\nand is the “gold standard” choice for psychotherapy.\\n07/09/2025, 22:20\\nPanic Disorder: What You Need to Know - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms\\n2/4'),\n",

Although many people may be concerned about their health, \\nweight, or appearance from time to time, some people become fixated or obsessed \\nwith weight loss, body weight or shape, and controlling their food intake. These \\nmay be signs of an eating disorder. \\nEating disorders are not a choice. These disorders can adversely affect a person’s \\nphysical and mental health, and in some cases, they can be life-threatening. With \\ntreatment, however, people can recover from eating disorders. \\nWho is at risk for eating disorders?\\nEating disorders can affect people of all ages, racial and ethnic backgrounds, \\nbody weights, and sexes. Even people who appear healthy can have eating \\ndisorders and be extremely ill. People with eating disorders can be underweight, \\naverage weight, or overweight. \\nThe exact cause of eating disorders is not fully understood. Research suggests a \\ncombination of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors \\ncan raise a person’s risk. \\nWhat are the common types of eating disorders?\\nCommon types of eating disorders include:\\n●Anorexia nervosa: People with anorexia nervosa severely avoid or restrict\\nfood intake due to a distorted self-image or an intense fear of gaining\\nweight. Even when dangerously underweight, they may see themselves as\\noverweight. Some people with anorexia nervosa may also have binge eating\\nand purging episodes.\\n●Binge-eating disorder: People with binge-eating disorder regularly lose\\ncontrol of their eating and eat unusually large amounts of food. People with\\nbinge-eating disorder are often overweight or obese.\\n●Bulimia nervosa: People with bulimia nervosa regularly binge eat and then\\nengage in unhealthy behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting\\nor the use of laxatives. People with bulimia nervosa may maintain an average\\nweight or be overweight.\\n●Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): People with ARFID limit\\nthe amount and variety of food they eat due to their anxiety or fear of the\\nconsequences of eating (such as choking or vomiting) or dislike of a food’s\\ncharacteristics (such as its appearance or texture). People with ARFID are\\nfrequently underweight.\\nPeople exhibiting any combination of these symptoms may have an eating \\ndisorder and should talk to a health care provider.'),\n",

Their\\ninterests, values, and feelings can change quickly. They also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. This is often seen in\\nsocial interactions, which may swing from extreme closeness to extreme dislike, resulting in unstable relationships and emotional pain.\\nOther symptoms can include:\\nAvoiding real or perceived abandonment, such as by jumping into or out of relationships quickly\\nA pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones\\nHigh sensitivity to rejection and feelings of alienation or isolation\\nA distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self\\nIntense and highly variable moods, with episodes lasting from a few hours to a few days\\nChronic feelings of emptiness\\nInappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger\\nFeelings of dissociation, such as being cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside the body, or feeling disconnected from one’s\\nsurroundings\\nSelf-harming behavior, such as cutting\\nRecurring thoughts of suicide, threats of suicide, or suicidal behaviors\\nSome people engage in impulsive or reckless behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance use, dangerous driving, and binge\\neating.

These include the following risk factors.\\nFamily history: People with a close family member (such as a parent or sibling) with the disorder may be at a higher risk of developing\\nborderline personality disorder.\\nBrain structure and function: Research shows that people with borderline personality disorder may have structural and functional\\nchanges in the brain, especially in areas that control impulses and regulate emotions. However, it is unclear whether these brain changes\\nare risk factors for the disorder or a product of having the disorder.\\nEnvironmental, cultural, and social factors: Many people with borderline personality disorder report experiencing traumatic life events,\\nsuch as abuse, neglect, maltreatment, abandonment, or hardship during childhood. Others may have been exposed to unstable,\\ninvalidating relationships or frequent interpersonal conflicts.\\nAlthough these factors may increase the risk for borderline personality disorder, experiencing them doesn’t mean a person will develop the\\ndisorder. Likewise, people without these risk factors can have the disorder as well.\\nHow is borderline personality disorder diagnosed?\\nA licensed mental health professional can diagnose borderline personality disorder based on a thorough discussion of symptoms and personal\\nand family history, including history of mental illness. A medical exam can further rule out other possible causes.\\nBorderline personality disorder is usually diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Occasionally, a person younger than 18 years will be\\ndiagnosed with the disorder if symptoms are severe and last at least a year.\\nWhat other conditions can co-occur with borderline personality disorder?\\nBorderline personality disorder often co-occurs with other mental and physical conditions. These can include mood disorders like depression and\\nbipolar disorder, externalizing disorders like conduct problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and metabolic-related disorders like\\ndiabetes and obesity.\\nThese co-occurring conditions can make it harder to diagnose and treat borderline personality disorder, especially if the symptoms overlap. For\\nexample, a person with borderline personality disorder may be more likely to experience symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress\\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or eating disorders.\\nOverlaps between borderline personality disorder and other disorders can reflect shared features (for instance, impulsive behaviors are common\\nin borderline personality disorder and a key symptom of bipolar disorder). However, symptoms of borderline personality disorder occur in the\\nabsence of significantly elevated mood seen during manic or hypomanic episodes, which is a key feature of bipolar disorder.\\nHow is borderline personality disorder treated?\\nEvidence-based treatments have been shown to help many people with borderline personality disorder experience fewer and less severe\\nsymptoms, improve their functioning, and have a better quality of life. People with the disorder should receive treatment from a licensed mental\\nhealth professional.\\nMany factors affect how long symptoms take to improve once treatment begins. It is important that people with borderline personality disorder\\nand their loved ones be patient and receive support during treatment.\\xa0It is also important to not only seek out—but stick with—treatment.\\nStudies funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) indicate that people with borderline personality disorder who do not receive\\nadequate treatment are more likely to develop other chronic illnesses and are less likely to make healthy lifestyle choices.\\nPsychotherapy\\nPsychotherapy, or talk therapy, is the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder. Most psychotherapy occurs with a licensed, trained\\nmental health professional in one-on-one sessions or with other people in group settings. Group sessions may help people with borderline\\npersonality disorder learn to interact more constructively with others and express themselves more effectively.\\n08/09/2025, 14:20\\nBorderline Personality Disorder - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/borderline-personality-disorder\\n2/4'),\n",

They may look at \\nschool reports or other childhood records.\\nA provider will also talk to you and may ask you to \\ndo the following: \\n \\n►Complete clinical interviews, behavior rating \\nscales, or symptom checklists to determine \\nwhether you meet the criteria for a diagnosis \\nof ADHD.\\n \\n►Take psychological tests that look at cognitive \\nprocesses, such as memory, planning, decision-\\nmaking, reasoning, and thinking, to identify strengths \\nand challenges and possible learning disabilities.\\n \\n►Report on your mood and current and past \\nmedical conditions to rule out alternative \\ndiagnoses and establish an overall treatment plan.\\nWhy wasn’t I diagnosed with \\nADHD earlier? \\nThere are many reasons someone may not be \\ndiagnosed with ADHD until adulthood. For instance, \\nyour teachers and parents may not have recognized \\nthe disorder or may have provided supportive \\nenvironments that helped you thrive despite it. Or \\nyou may have a milder form of ADHD that could be \\nmanaged well until faced with the stresses and \\ndemands of adulthood, especially at work. \\nADHD symptoms among girls and women \\nare especially likely to have been missed in \\nchildhood.

People \\nsometimes refer to bipolar disorder with the older terms manic-depressive disorder or \\nmanic depression.\\nEveryone experiences ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, the range of mood \\nchanges can be extreme. People with the disorder have manic episodes or unusually \\nelevated moods in which the person might feel excessively happy, irritable, or “up,” \\nwith a marked increase in activity level compared to their usual self. They might also \\nhave depressive episodes, in which they feel sad, indifferent, or hopeless, combined \\nwith a very low activity level and an inability to function. Some people have hypomanic \\nepisodes, which are like manic episodes but are less severe, and don’t interfere as \\nmuch with daily life.\\nMost of the time, bipolar disorder symptoms start during late adolescence or early \\nadulthood. Occasionally, children may experience bipolar disorder symptoms. \\nAlthough symptoms may come and go, bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong \\ntreatment and does not go away on its own. Bipolar disorder can be an important \\nfactor in suicide, job loss, ability to function, and family discord. However, proper \\ntreatment can lead to better functioning and improved quality of life.\\nWhat are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?\\nSymptoms of bipolar disorder can vary. An individual with the disorder may have \\nmanic episodes, depressive episodes, or “mixed” episodes. A mixed episode has \\nboth manic and depressive symptoms. \\nThese mood episodes cause symptoms that last a week or two, or sometimes \\nlonger. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. \\nFeelings are intense and happen with changes in behavior, energy levels, or \\nactivity levels that are noticeable to others. In between episodes, mood usually \\nreturns to a healthy baseline. But in many cases, without adequate treatment, \\nepisodes occur more frequently as time goes on.\\nSome people with bipolar disorder may have milder symptoms than others. For \\nexample, hypomanic episodes may make an individual feel very good and productive; \\nthey may not feel like anything is wrong. However, family and friends may notice \\nmood swings and changes in activity levels as unusual behavior, and depressive \\nepisodes may follow hypomanic episodes.'),\n",

The experience of four or more episodes of mania or depression \\nwithin a year is termed “rapid cycling.”\\n \\n●Bipolar II disorder is defined by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic \\nepisodes, but the hypomanic episodes are less severe than the manic episodes \\nin bipolar I disorder. Many people with bipolar II disorder spend extended \\nperiods in a persistent, low-grade depressive state.\\n \\n●Cyclothymic disorder (also called cyclothymia) is defined by recurrent \\nhypomanic and depressive symptoms that are not intense enough or do not last \\nlong enough to qualify as hypomanic or depressive episodes. \\n“Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders” is a diagnosis that \\nrefers to bipolar disorder symptoms that do not match the three major types of \\nbipolar disorder outlined above.'),\n",

However, research suggests that a \\ncombination of factors may contribute to the illness.\\nGenetics\\nBipolar disorder often runs in families, and research suggests this is mostly explained \\nby heredity—people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder \\nthan others. Many genes are involved, and no one gene can cause the disorder. \\nBut genes are not the only factor. Studies of identical twins have shown that one \\ntwin can develop bipolar disorder while the other does not. Though people with a \\nparent or sibling with bipolar disorder are more likely to develop it, not everyone \\nwith a family history of bipolar disorder will develop it. Research also suggests that \\npeople with a genetic risk of having bipolar disorder may be more likely to develop \\nit after experiencing trauma or other stressful life events.\\nBrain structure and function\\nResearch shows that the brain structure and function of people with bipolar disorder \\nmay differ from those of people who do not have bipolar disorder or other mental \\ndisorders. Learning about the nature of these brain changes helps researchers \\nbetter understand bipolar disorder and, in the future, may help predict which types \\nof treatment will work best for a person with bipolar disorder. \\nHow is bipolar disorder diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose bipolar disorder, a health care provider may complete a physical exam, \\norder medical testing to rule out other illnesses, and refer the person for an \\nevaluation by a mental health professional.\\nBipolar disorder is diagnosed based on the severity, length, and frequency of an \\nindividual’s symptoms and experiences over their lifetime, and their family history. \\nSome people have bipolar disorder for years before it is diagnosed for several \\nreasons. People with bipolar II disorder may seek help only for depressive \\nepisodes, and hypomanic episodes may go unnoticed.\\nMisdiagnosis may happen because some bipolar disorder symptoms are like those \\nof other illnesses. For example, people with bipolar disorder who also have psychotic \\nsymptoms can be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. To avoid such misdiagnosis, it \\nis important to consider the course of the disorder over the past days and weeks, \\nrather than focusing solely on the current symptoms. Some health conditions, such \\nas thyroid disease, can cause symptoms like those of bipolar disorder. The effects \\nof some prescribed, recreational, or illicit drugs can sometimes mimic or worsen \\nmood symptoms.\\nIf subtle signs of bipolar disorder are missed and an initial depressive episode is \\ntreated with antidepressant medication alone (without a mood stabilizer), a manic \\nepisode or rapid cycling may be triggered.'),\n",

It is important to \\ngive a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it is right for you. \\nYou may need to try several medications to find the best one.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a medication \\ncalled brexanolone specifically to treat severe postpartum depression. \\nBrexanolone, which is administered through an IV during a brief hospital stay, \\nappears to work differently than traditional antidepressants by rapidly altering \\na brain chemical that may play an important role in regulating the body’s \\nvulnerability to depression and anxiety. \\nMore recently, the FDA approved a pill called zuranolone as the first oral \\nmedication for postpartum depression in adults. Zuranolone acts on similar \\nbrain receptors to brexanolone. In clinical trials, the pill reduced depressive \\nsymptoms in women with severe postpartum depression more quickly than \\ntraditional antidepressants. \\nNote: In some cases, people under 25 years may experience an increase\\nin suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in \\nthe first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. The FDA \\nadvises that patients of all ages taking antidepressants be watched closely, \\nespecially during the first few weeks of treatment.\\nThe risk of birth defects and other problems for babies of mothers who take \\nantidepressants during pregnancy is very low. However, women should always \\nlet a health care provider know if they are pregnant or nursing and work with \\nthe provider to minimize the baby’s exposure to medication and weigh the risks \\nand benefits of available treatment options.

They \\nalso can help parents develop new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to their child. Examples \\ninclude parenting skills training, stress management techniques for parents, and support groups that \\nhelp parents and families connect with others who have similar concerns.\\nSchool-based programs\\nMany children and teens with ADHD benefit from school-based behavioral interventions and\\nacademic accommodations. Interventions include behavior management plans or classroom-taught \\norganizational and study skills. Accommodations include preferential seating in the classroom, \\nreduced classwork, and extended time on tests and exams. Schools may provide accommodations \\nthrough what is called a 504 Plan or, for children who qualify for special education services, an \\nIndividualized Education Plan (IEP).  \\nTo learn more about special education services and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \\nvisit https://idea.ed.gov.'),\n",

Exercises are tailored to the \\nperson’s ongoing performance. \\nCognitive training is shown to modestly improve the tasks being practiced. For instance, research shows \\nthe training can help memory, attention, inhibition, planning, and cognitive flexibility in people with \\nADHD. However, these improvements don’t usually translate to changes in core ADHD symptoms of \\nimpulsivity and hyperactivity.\\nNeurofeedback\\nNeurofeedback is a noninvasive technique in which an electronic device monitors and records a \\nperson’s brain activity, providing them with immediate feedback to support self-regulation. The \\ndevice measures brain activity through such means as EEG or fMRI scans and feeds the information \\nback to the person, usually in the form of a computer screen or visual cue. Through this feedback, \\npeople learn to self-regulate their brain activity to directly alter the associated behavior. The \\nassumption is that, with repeated, real-time information, people can change their internal brain \\nactivity, with observable effects on behavior and cognition. \\nFor people with ADHD, neurofeedback is used to train and improve specific cognitive functions. \\nAlthough it is shown to help reduce some ADHD symptoms, the effects of neurofeedback remain \\nlower than those seen from medication and psychotherapy.

Fear is a part \\nof the body’s “fight-or-flight” response, which helps us avoid or respond to \\npotential danger. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, \\nand most will recover from their symptoms over time. Those who continue \\nto experience symptoms may be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \\ndisorder (PTSD). \\nWho develops PTSD?\\nAnyone can develop PTSD at any age. This includes combat veterans and \\npeople who have experienced or witnessed a physical or sexual assault, abuse, \\nan accident, a disaster, a terror attack, or other serious events. People who have \\nPTSD may feel stressed or frightened, even when they are no longer in danger.\\nNot everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event. Sometimes, \\nlearning that a relative or close friend experienced trauma can cause PTSD.\\nAbout 6 of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their \\nlifetime, according to the National Center for PTSD, a U.S. Department of \\nVeterans Affairs program. Women are more likely than men to develop PTSD. \\nCertain aspects of the traumatic event and biological factors (such as genes) \\nmay make some people more likely to develop PTSD.\\nWhat are the symptoms of PTSD?\\nSymptoms of PTSD usually begin within 3 months of the traumatic event, but they \\nsometimes emerge later. To meet the criteria for PTSD, a person must have \\nsymptoms for longer than 1 month, and the symptoms must be severe enough \\nto interfere with aspects of daily life, such as relationships or work. The \\nsymptoms also must be unrelated to medication, substance use, or other illness.\\nThe course of the disorder varies. Although some people recover within \\n6 months, others have symptoms that last for 1 year or longer. People with PTSD \\noften have co-occurring conditions, such as depression, substance use, or one \\nor more anxiety disorders.\\nAfter a dangerous event, it is natural to have some symptoms. For example, \\nsome people may feel detached from the experience, as though they are \\nobserving things as an outsider rather than experiencing them. A mental health \\nprofessional—such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker—can \\ndetermine whether symptoms meet the criteria for PTSD.'),\n",

A person with social anxiety disorder feels symptoms of anxiety or fear in situations\\nwhere they may be scrutinized, evaluated, or judged by others, such as speaking in public, meeting new people, dating, being on a job interview,\\nanswering a question in class, asking for help, or having to talk to a cashier in a store. Doing everyday things, such as eating or drinking in front of\\nothers or using a public restroom, may also cause anxiety or fear due to concerns about being humiliated, judged, or rejected.\\nThis fear often feels uncontrollable and can interfere with daily life. People with social anxiety disorder may worry about engaging in social\\nsituations for weeks before they happen. Sometimes, they end up avoiding places or events that cause distress or generate feelings of\\nembarrassment. In some cases, anxiety may arise only during performance situations such as giving a speech, competing in a sports game, or\\nplaying a musical instrument on stage.\\nSocial anxiety disorder usually starts during childhood or adolescence and may resemble extreme shyness or avoidance of public situations or\\nsocial interactions. It occurs more frequently in women than in men, and this difference is more pronounced in adolescents and young adults.\\nWith the right treatment and support, people with social anxiety disorder can manage their anxiety and improve their quality of life.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder?\\nWhen having to perform in front of or be around others, people with social anxiety disorder may:\\nBlush, sweat, or tremble\\nHave a rapid heart rate\\nFeel their “mind going blank,” or feel sick to their stomach\\nHave a rigid body posture or speak with an overly soft voice\\nFind it difficult to make eye contact, be around people they don’t know, or talk to people in social situations, even when they want to\\nFeel self-consciousness or fear that people will judge them negatively\\nAvoid places where there are other people or situations where they may have to interact with others\\nAnalyze their performance and identify self-perceived flaws in interactions\\nExpect the worst possible consequences from a negative social situation\\nChildren and teens with social anxiety disorder may experience similar symptoms to adults, but also may:\\nTry to avoid going to school\\nHave difficulty making friends\\nComplain of stomachaches or headaches\\nHave emotional outbursts in social situations\\nRefuse to speak or participate in social situations\\nFor all people with social anxiety disorder, symptoms may fluctuate over time and are often worse during times of significant stress or change.\\nAvoiding situations that cause anxiety may feel helpful in the short term, but the anxiety is likely to remain without treatment.\\nIs it normal stress or an anxiety disorder?\\nLife can be stressful—a person may feel stressed about a demanding job, a performance at school, or a life change. Everyone feels stress\\nfrom time to time.\\nRemove from Print\\n07/09/2025, 22:21\\nSocial Anxiety Disorder: What You Need to Know - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social-anxiety-disorder-more-than-just-shyness\\n1/4'),\n",

A stressor may be a\\none-time or short-term occurrence, or it can happen repeatedly over a long time.\\nAnxiety is the body's reaction to stress and can occur even if there is no current threat.\\nWhile occasional stress and anxiety are normal, they shouldn’t control your life. If anxiety doesn’t go away and begins to interfere with your\\ndaily activities, you may have an anxiety disorder. Learn more about\\xa0stress.\\nWhat causes social anxiety disorder?\\nSocial anxiety disorder may run in families, but no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others don’t. Researchers have\\nfound that several parts of the brain are involved in fear and anxiety, and genetics influences how these brain areas function. In addition,\\nresearchers are looking at the role that stress and environmental factors play in the disorder.\\nHow is social anxiety disorder diagnosed?\\nTo be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, a person must have strong fear or anxiety about social situations where they might be judged or\\nscrutinized by others. They may try to avoid these situations or face them with extreme discomfort. These feelings must last at least 6 months\\nand interfere with daily life, such as work, school, or relationships.\\nIf you think you’re experiencing symptoms of social anxiety disorder, talk to a health care provider, such as a primary care doctor, psychiatrist,\\npsychologist, or clinical social worker. During the visit, the provider may ask when your symptoms began, how long they have lasted, how often\\nthey occur, and their impact on your life. After discussing your history, the provider may conduct a physical exam to ensure that an unrelated\\nphysical problem is not causing your symptoms.\\nWhat other illnesses can co-occur with social anxiety disorder?\\nSome people with social anxiety disorder have other mental and physical health disorders or conditions, including depression, other anxiety\\ndisorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), body dysmorphic disorder, or bipolar disorder. Social\\nanxiety disorder is also commonly associated with alcohol and substance misuse.\\nPeople with social anxiety disorder are less likely to seek help from a health care provider for diagnosis or treatment. Providers often identify the\\ndisorder when treating a person for a co-existing condition.\\nThe presence of multiple disorders can make treatment more complex, and people with social anxiety disorder and co-occurring mental\\ndisorders may benefit from a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses all aspects of their mental health.\\nHow is social anxiety disorder treated?\\nTreatment for social anxiety disorder typically involves psychotherapy, medication, or both. Choosing the right treatment plan is based on a\\nperson’s needs, preferences, and medical situation, as well as consultation with a mental health professional or a health care provider. Finding\\nthe best treatment may take trial and error, and psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work.\\nPsychotherapy\\nPsychotherapy (also called talk therapy or counseling) can be effective when delivered in person or virtually via telehealth. A provider may\\nsupport or supplement therapy using digital or mobile technology, like apps or other tools. Different therapies work for different types of people.\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a research-supported type of psychotherapy, is commonly used to treat social anxiety disorder. CBT teaches\\na person different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations to help them feel less anxious and fearful. CBT also can help a person\\nlearn and practice social skills, which is very important for treating social anxiety disorder. CBT has been well studied and is the “gold standard”\\nchoice for psychotherapy.\\n07/09/2025, 22:21\\nSocial Anxiety Disorder: What You Need to Know - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social-anxiety-disorder-more-than-just-shyness\\n2/4\"),\n",

Beta-\\nblockers are commonly the medication of choice for the “performance anxiety” type of social anxiety disorder.\\nBenzodiazepines, which are anti-anxiety sedative medications, are powerful and begin working right away to reduce anxious feelings. These\\nmedications can be very effective in rapidly decreasing anxiety, but some people build up a tolerance to them and need increasing doses to get\\nthe same effect.

In a group of people who all have social anxiety disorder, a person can receive\\nunbiased, honest feedback about how others perceive them. This allows them to learn that their thoughts about judgment and rejection may not\\nbe true or are distorted. A person can also learn how others with social anxiety disorder approach and overcome the fear of social situations.\\nSupport groups are available both in person and online. However, any advice you receive from a support group member should be used\\ncautiously and does not replace treatment recommendations from a health care provider.\\nHealthy habits\\nPracticing a healthy lifestyle also can help combat anxiety, although this alone cannot replace treatment. Make sure to get enough sleep and\\nexercise, eat a healthy diet, and turn to family and friends you trust for support.

Treatment can help \\npeople remain in school, maintain employment, achieve independence, and \\nenjoy personal relationships.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia?\\nIt’s important to recognize the symptoms of schizophrenia and seek help as \\nearly as possible. People with schizophrenia are usually diagnosed between \\nthe ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of psychosis. Starting treatment \\nas soon as possible following the first episode of psychosis is an important \\nstep toward recovery. However, research shows that gradual changes in \\nthinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of \\npsychosis. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children.\\nSchizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally \\nfall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.\\nPsychotic symptoms\\nPsychotic symptoms include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and \\nexperiences the world. A person experiencing psychotic symptoms often has \\ndisrupted thoughts and perceptions, and they may have difficulty recognizing \\nwhat is real and what is not. For some people, these symptoms come and go. \\nFor others, the symptoms become stable over time. Psychotic symptoms \\ninclude hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder.\\n \\n►Hallucinations\\xa0are when a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels \\nthings that are not there. Hearing voices is common among people with \\nschizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time \\nbefore family or friends notice a problem.\\n \\n►Delusions\\xa0are when a person has strong beliefs that are not objectively \\ntrue and may seem irrational to others. For example, individuals \\nexperiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio and television \\nare sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may \\nbelieve that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.'),\n",

In most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood.\\nSAD occurs much more often in women than in men. \\nWinter-pattern SAD also occurs more often than summer-\\npattern SAD. Therefore, SAD is more common in people \\nliving farther north, where there are shorter daylight hours in \\nthe winter. For example, people in Alaska or New England \\nare more likely to develop SAD than people in Texas or Florida. \\nSAD is more common in people with depression or bipolar \\ndisorder, especially bipolar II disorder, which involves \\nrepeated depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes \\n(less severe than the typical manic episodes of bipolar I \\ndisorder). Additionally, people with SAD tend to have other \\nmental disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity \\ndisorder, eating disorder, anxiety disorder, or panic disorder. \\nLearn more about these disorders at www.nimh.nih.gov/health.\\nSAD sometimes runs in families and may be more common \\nin people who have relatives with other mental illnesses, \\nsuch as depression or schizophrenia.\\nWhat causes SAD?\\nResearchers are still determining what causes SAD. Most \\nresearch to date has investigated potential causes of \\nwinter-pattern SAD because it is more common and easier \\nto study. As a result, less is known about summer-pattern \\nSAD, and more research is needed.\\nStudies indicate that people with SAD, especially winter-\\npattern SAD, have reduced levels of the brain chemical \\nserotonin, which helps regulate mood. Research also \\nsuggests that sunlight affects levels of molecules that help \\nmaintain normal serotonin levels. Shorter daylight hours may \\nprevent these molecules from functioning properly, \\ncontributing to decreased serotonin levels in the winter.\\nVitamin D deficiency may exacerbate these problems in \\npeople with winter-pattern SAD because vitamin D is \\nbelieved to promote serotonin activity. In addition to vitamin \\nD consumed in food, the body produces vitamin D when \\nexposed to sunlight on the skin. With less daylight in the \\nwinter, people with SAD may have lower vitamin D levels, \\nfurther reducing serotonin activity.\\nOther studies suggest that both forms of SAD relate to \\naltered levels of melatonin—a hormone important for \\nmaintaining the normal sleep−wake cycle. People with \\nwinter-pattern SAD produce too much melatonin, which can \\nincrease sleepiness and lead to oversleeping. \\nIn contrast, people with summer-pattern SAD may have \\nreduced melatonin levels, consistent with long, hot days \\nworsening sleep quality and leading to depression \\nsymptoms. Longer daylight hours, shorter nights, and high \\ntemperatures can also cause sleep disruptions. However, \\nthese theories have not been systematically tested. \\nBoth serotonin and melatonin help maintain the body’s daily \\nrhythm tied to the seasonal night−day cycle. In people with \\nSAD, changes in serotonin and melatonin disrupt normal \\ndaily rhythms. As a result, they can no longer adjust to \\nseasonal changes in day length, leading to sleep, mood, and \\nbehavior changes.\\nNegative thoughts and feelings about the winter or summer \\nand its associated limitations and stresses are also common \\namong people with SAD (as well as others). It is unclear, \\nhowever, whether these thoughts are causes or effects of the \\nmood disorder, but they can be a useful focus of treatment.'),\n",

It aims to expose people with SAD to a \\nbright light to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in \\ndarker months.\\nFor this treatment, the person sits in front of a very bright \\nlight box (10,000 lux) every day for about 30−45 minutes, \\nusually first thing in the morning, from fall to spring. The light \\nbox, which is about 20 times brighter than ordinary indoor \\nlight, filters out the potentially damaging UV light, making \\nthis a safe treatment for most. However, people with certain \\neye diseases or people taking certain medications that \\nincrease sensitivity to sunlight may need to use alternative \\ntreatments or use light therapy under medical supervision.\\nPsychotherapy\\nPsychotherapy (also called talk therapy or counseling) can help \\npeople with SAD by teaching them new ways of thinking and \\nbehaving and changing habits that contribute to depression. \\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy \\naimed at helping people learn to challenge and change \\nunhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve their depressive \\nand anxious feelings. CBT has been adapted for people with \\nSAD (known as CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD is typically conducted in \\ntwo weekly group sessions for 6 weeks that focus on replacing \\nnegative thoughts related to the season, such as thoughts \\nabout the darkness of winter or the heat of summer, with \\nmore positive thoughts. CBT-SAD also uses a process called \\nbehavioral activation, which helps people identify and \\nschedule pleasant, engaging indoor or outdoor activities to \\noffset the loss of interest they typically experience in the \\nwinter or summer.\\nWhen researchers directly compared CBT-SAD with light \\ntherapy, both treatments were equally effective in improving \\nSAD symptoms—although some symptoms got better \\nslightly faster with light therapy than CBT. However, a \\nlong-term study that followed SAD patients for two winters \\nfound that the positive effects of CBT seemed to last longer. \\nLearn more about psychotherapy at www.nimh.nih.gov/\\npsychotherapies. \\nAntidepressant medication\\nMedications used to treat depression (antidepressants) can \\nbe effective for SAD when used alone or in combination with \\ntalk therapy. Antidepressants work by changing how the brain \\nproduces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress. \\nAntidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work. \\nProblems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve \\nbefore mood lifts. It is important to give a medication a chance \\nto work before deciding whether it is right for you. You may \\nneed to try several medications to find the one that works best.\\nBecause SAD, like other types of depression, is associated with \\ndisturbances in serotonin activity, antidepressant medications \\ncalled selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are sometimes \\nused to treat symptoms. These medications can significantly \\nenhance a person’s mood. \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved \\nan antidepressant called bupropion in an extended-release \\nform designed to last longer in the body. For many people, \\nbupropion can prevent the recurrence of seasonal depressive \\nepisodes when taken daily from the fall through early spring.\\nAll medications can have side effects. Talk to a health care \\nprovider before starting or stopping any medication. Learn \\nmore about antidepressants at www.nimh.nih.gov/medications. \\nYou can also learn about specific medications like bupropion, \\nincluding the latest approvals, side effects, warnings, and \\npatient information, on the FDA website at www.fda.gov/\\ndrugsatfda. \\nVitamin D\\nBecause many people with winter-pattern SAD have vitamin D \\ndeficiency, vitamin D supplements may help improve symptoms. \\nHowever, studies testing vitamin D as a treatment for SAD \\nhave produced mixed results, with some studies indicating \\nthat it is as effective as light therapy and other studies \\nfinding no effect.\\nTalk to a health care provider about any dietary supplements \\nand prescription or over-the-counter medications you are \\ntaking.

The symptoms of DMDD go beyond a “bad \\nmood.” DMDD symptoms are severe. \\nYouth with DMDD experience significant problems at \\nhome, at school, and often with peers. They also tend \\nto require mental health care services, including \\ndoctor visits and sometimes hospitalization. \\nAdditionally, these children are at an increased risk of \\ndeveloping anxiety and depression in the future. \\nDMDD can be treated. If you are concerned that your \\nchild may have DMDD, talk to your child’s pediatrician \\nor health care provider.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms\\nof DMDD? \\nChildren or adolescents with DMDD experience: \\n• Severe temper outbursts (verbal or behavioral), on \\naverage, 3 or more times per week \\n• Outbursts and tantrums that have been happening \\nregularly for at least 12 months \\n• Chronically irritable or angry mood most of the day, \\nnearly every day \\n• Trouble functioning due to irritability in more than \\none place, such as at home, at school, or with peers\\nYouth with DMDD are diagnosed between the ages of \\n6 and 10. To be diagnosed with DMDD, a child must have \\nexperienced symptoms steadily for 12 or more months. \\nOver time, as children grow and develop, the symptoms \\nof DMDD may change. For example, an adolescent\\nor young adult with DMDD may experience fewer \\ntantrums, but they may begin to exhibit symptoms of \\ndepression or anxiety. For this reason, treatment may \\nchange over time, too. \\nChildren with DMDD may have trouble in school and \\ndifficulty maintaining healthy relationships with family \\nor peers. They also may have a hard time in social \\nsettings or participating in activities such as team \\nsports. If you think your child has DMDD, seeking a \\ndiagnosis and treatment is essential.\\nDid you know? \\nDMDD was added to the Diagnostic and \\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) \\nin 2013. The DSM is used to assess and diagnose \\nmental disorders. For more information on DMDD, \\nvisit www.nimh.nih.gov/dmdd. \\nWhat is the difference between \\ntypical and severe irritability? \\nAll children can become irritable sometimes. \\nIt’s a normal reaction to frustration. Children \\nexperiencing severe irritability (as observed in \\nDMDD) have difficulty tolerating frustration and \\nhave outbursts that are out of proportion to the \\nsituation at hand. These outbursts occur more \\noften and are more severe than expected for \\nchildren their age. \\nFor example, a parent tells the child to stop \\nplaying a game and do their homework. Any \\nchild might be frustrated or annoyed. But a child \\nwith DMDD may become extremely upset and \\nemotional and have an intense temper outburst \\nwith yelling or hitting. A child with DMDD \\nexperiences these intense temper outbursts a \\nfew times a week.\\nDisruptive Mood \\nDysregulation \\nDisorder: The Basics'),\n",

Current \\ntreatments are primarily based on what has been \\nhelpful for other childhood disorders associated with \\nirritability, such as ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, \\nand anxiety disorders. \\nTreatment for DMDD generally includes certain types \\nof psychotherapy (sometimes called talk therapy) and \\nsometimes medications. In many cases, psychotherapy \\nis considered first, with medication added later. \\nHowever, at times, providers recommend that children \\nreceive both psychotherapy and medication at the \\nstart of their treatment. \\nNIMH is funding studies focused on improving these \\ntreatments and identifying new treatments specifically \\nfor DMDD. Parents or caregivers should work closely \\nwith their child’s health care provider to make treatment \\ndecisions that are best for their child. \\nPsychotherapy \\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) targets the \\nrelationship between thoughts, behaviors, and feelings \\nand is often effective in treating anger and disruptive \\nbehavior. Researchers at NIMH are also using CBT to \\nhelp children increase their ability to tolerate frustration \\nwithout having an outburst. This therapy teaches \\ncoping skills for controlling anger and ways to identify \\nand relabel the distorted perceptions that contribute \\nto outbursts.\\nParent training teaches parents or caregivers more \\neffective ways to respond to irritable behavior, such \\nas anticipating events that might lead a child to temper \\noutbursts and working ahead to avert them. Training \\nalso emphasizes the importance of predictable and \\nconsistent responses to a child’s outbursts and \\nrewards for positive behavior.\\nTo learn more about psychotherapy, visit www.nimh.\\nnih.gov/psychotherapies. \\nMedication \\nCurrently, there are no medications approved by the \\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically \\nfor treating children or adolescents with DMDD. \\nHowever, health care providers may prescribe certain \\nmedications—such as stimulants, antidepressants, \\nand atypical antipsychotics—to help relieve your \\nchild’s DMDD symptoms. \\nAll medications have side effects. Monitor and report \\nyour child’s side effects and review the medications \\nfrequently with your child’s health care provider.

Many people worry about things such as health, money, school, work, or family. But people with\\ngeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) feel extremely worried or nervous more frequently or more intensely about these and other things—even\\nwhen the worry is out of proportion with the situation.\\nGAD usually involves a persistent feeling of anxiety or dread that interferes with how you live your life. It is not the same as occasionally worrying\\nabout things or experiencing anxiety due to stressful life events. For people with GAD, these feelings of anxiety can last for months or even years.\\nGAD develops gradually and usually starts in early adulthood, although it can occur at any age. Women are more likely than men to experience\\nGAD, with some women experiencing it during pregnancy and the postpartum period. With the right treatment and support, people with GAD\\ncan manage their anxiety and improve their quality of life.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder?\\nPeople with GAD may:\\nWorry excessively about everyday things\\nHave trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness\\nFeel irritable or “on edge” frequently\\nFeel restless or have trouble relaxing\\nHave a hard time concentrating\\nHave trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or feel fatigued\\nExperience pain such as headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or tension\\nTremble or twitch\\nSweat a lot, feel lightheaded, or feel out of breath\\nHave a hard time swallowing\\nMake frequent trips to the bathroom\\nAdults with GAD are often highly nervous about everyday circumstances, such as:\\nJob security or performance\\nHealth\\nFinances\\nThe health and well-being of their children or other family members\\nBeing late\\nCompleting household chores and other responsibilities\\nChildren and teens with GAD may worry about many of the same things as adults, but their concerns often center on school, extracurricular\\nactivities, friendships, and the future. They may struggle with uncertainty, fear of making mistakes, or worry about disappointing others. Children\\nand teens with GAD may strive for perfection as a way to manage their anxiety.\\nFor all people with GAD, symptoms may fluctuate over time and are often worse during times of stress—for example, during a physical illness,\\nschool exams, or a family or relationship conflict.\\nRemove from Print\\n08/09/2025, 14:20\\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder: What You Need to Know - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad\\n1/4'),\n",

Learn more about\\xa0stress.\\nWhat causes generalized anxiety disorder?\\nGAD may run in families, but the exact cause of the disorder is unknown. Research suggests that GAD results from a mix of genetics, brain\\nchemistry, biology, and environment. Researchers have found that external causes, such as experiencing a traumatic event or being in a stressful\\nenvironment, may put a person at higher risk for developing GAD.\\nHow is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed?\\nTo be diagnosed with GAD, a person must find it difficult to control worry on most days for at least 6 months. They must also have at least three\\nof these symptoms: feeling restless or “on edge,” fatigue, trouble concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or problems with sleep.\\nIf you think you’re experiencing symptoms of GAD, talk to a health care provider, such as a primary care doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, or\\nclinical social worker. During the visit, the provider may ask when your symptoms began, how long they have lasted, how often they occur, and\\ntheir impact on your life. After discussing your history, the provider may conduct a physical exam to ensure that an unrelated physical problem is\\nnot causing your symptoms.\\nWhat other illnesses can co-occur with generalized anxiety disorder?\\nSome people with GAD have other mental and physical health disorders or conditions, including depression, other anxiety disorders, post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder, chronic pain syndromes, cardiovascular problems, or suicidal thoughts or behaviors. GAD is also commonly associated\\nwith alcohol and substance misuse.\\nThe presence of multiple disorders can make treatment more complex, and people with GAD and co-occurring mental disorders may benefit\\nfrom a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses all aspects of their mental health.\\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\\xa0 at 988 or chat at\\n988lifeline.org\\xa0.

CBT helps people become\\naware of automatic ways of thinking that are inaccurate or harmful and then question those thoughts, understand how the thoughts affect their\\nemotions and behavior, and change self-defeating behavior patterns to feel less anxious and worried. CBT has been well studied and is the “gold\\nstandard” choice for psychotherapy.\\nAnother treatment option for GAD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT takes a different approach than CBT, encouraging\\nnonjudgmental acceptance of thoughts and behaviors and promoting engagement in meaningful activities. ACT uses strategies such as\\nmindfulness and goal setting to reduce a person’s discomfort and anxiety. There is a growing body of research demonstrating its effectiveness\\nfor treating GAD.\\nLearn more about\\xa0psychotherapy.\\nMedication\\nHealth care providers may prescribe medication to treat GAD. Different types of medication can be effective, including:\\nAntidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\\nAnti-anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines and buspirone\\nSSRI and SNRI antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression, but they also can help treat the symptoms of GAD. They may take several\\nweeks to start working. These medications also may cause side effects, such as headaches, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are\\nusually not severe for most people, especially if the dose starts low and is increased slowly over time.\\nBenzodiazepines, which are anti-anxiety sedative medications, also can be used to manage severe forms of GAD. These medications can be very\\neffective in rapidly decreasing anxiety, but some people build up a tolerance to them and need increasing doses to get the same effect. Some\\npeople even become dependent on them. Therefore, a health care provider may prescribe them only for brief periods of time.\\nBuspirone is another anti-anxiety medication that can be helpful in treating GAD. Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone is not a sedative and has\\nless potential to be addictive. Buspirone needs to be taken for 3–4 weeks for it to be fully effective.\\nLearn more about\\xa0mental health medications. Read\\xa0the most up-to-date information on medications, side effects, and warnings on the\\xa0U.S. Food\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) website\\xa0.\\nSupport groups\\nSome people with anxiety disorders benefit from joining a self-help or support group and sharing their problems and achievements with others.\\nSupport groups are available both in person and online. However, any advice you receive from a support group member should be used\\ncautiously and does not replace treatment recommendations from a health care provider.\\nHealthy habits\\nPracticing a healthy lifestyle also can help combat anxiety, although this alone cannot replace treatment. Researchers have found that\\nimplementing certain healthy choices in daily life—such as reducing caffeine intake and getting enough sleep—can reduce anxiety symptoms\\nwhen paired with standard care—such as psychotherapy and medication.\\nStress management techniques, such as exercise, mindfulness, and meditation, also can reduce anxiety symptoms and enhance the effects of\\npsychotherapy.

Here are five tips to help prepare and guide you \\non talking to a health care provider about your mental health and getting \\nthe most out of your visit.\\n1. Talk to a primary care provider.         \\nIf you don’t know where to start for help, you may want to consider bringing up your mental \\nhealth concerns during your appointment with a primary care provider (PCP). A PCP is a health \\ncare practitioner people see for common medical problems, and this person is often a doctor. \\nHowever, a PCP may be a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner. \\nMental health is an integral part of health, and people with mental disorders can often be at risk \\nfor other medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes. In many primary care settings, \\nyou may be asked if you’re feeling anxious or depressed, or if you have had thoughts of suicide. \\nEven if your PCP doesn’t ask you first, take this opportunity to talk to your PCP, who can help \\nrefer you to a mental health professional. You also can visit the NIMH Find Help for Mental \\nIllnesses webpage for help finding a health care provider or treatment.          \\n2. Prepare ahead of your visit.\\nHealth care providers have a limited time for each appointment, so it may be helpful to think of \\nyour questions or concerns beforehand.\\n \\n●Prepare your questions.\\xa0Make a list of what you want to discuss and any questions or concerns\\nyou might have. This worksheet may help you prepare your questions or concerns.\\n● Prepare a list of your medications. It’s important to tell your health care provider about all the\\nmedications you’re taking, including over-the-counter (nonprescription) drugs, herbal remedies,\\nvitamins, and supplements. This worksheet can help you track your medications.\\n● Review your family history. Certain mental illnesses tend to run in families and having a relative\\nwith a mental disorder could mean you’re at higher risk. Knowing your family mental health\\nhistory can help determine your risk for certain disorders. It can also help your health care\\nprovider recommend actions for reducing your risk and enable you and your provider to look\\nfor early warning signs.'),\n",

Consider bringing a friend or relative.\\nIt can be difficult to absorb all the information your health care provider shares, especially if \\nyou are not feeling well. Sometimes it’s helpful to bring a close friend or relative to your \\nappointment. A companion can be there for support, help you take notes, and remember what \\nyou and the provider discussed. They also might be able to offer input to your provider about \\nhow they think you are doing. Some people like having a friend or family member there \\nthroughout an appointment, while others prefer to first meet alone with a health care provider \\nand then have a trusted friend or relative join them when recommendations for treatments \\nare discussed.\\n4. Be honest.\\nYour health care provider can help you get better only if you have open and honest \\ncommunication. It is important to remember that discussions between you and a health care \\nprovider are private and cannot be shared with anyone without your expressed permission. \\nDescribe all your symptoms to your provider and be specific about when they started, how \\nsevere they are, and how often they occur. You should also share any major stressors or recent \\nlife changes that could be triggering or exacerbating your symptoms.\\nSymptoms of mental illnesses may include:\\n● Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood\\n● Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism\\n● Irritability\\n● Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness\\n● Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\\n● Decreased energy or fatigue\\n● Moving or talking more slowly\\n● Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still\\n● Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\\n● Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping\\n● Appetite or weight changes (or both)\\n● Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts\\n● Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear\\nphysical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment            \\n5. Ask questions.\\nIf you have questions or concerns, ask the health care provider for more information about the \\nmental health diagnosis or treatment. If a provider suggests a treatment option that you’re not \\ncomfortable or familiar with, express your concerns and ask if there are other options. You may \\ndecide to try a combination of treatment approaches and want to consider getting another \\nopinion from a different health care provider. It’s important to remember that there is no “one-\\nsize-fits-all” treatment. To find one that works best for you, you may need to talk to a few \\nother health care providers to find someone you are comfortable with and try several different \\ntreatments or a combination of treatments.'),\n",

PANS and PANDAS are also often associated with noticeable changes in mood, behavior, and sensory\\nand motor function in children.\\nPANS may be triggered by various infections, immune system issues, or environmental factors. PANDAS is a subtype of PANS and is specifically\\nassociated with an infection from streptococcal (strep) bacteria—such as strep throat or scarlet fever.\\nFor both conditions, the symptoms are usually intense, occur quickly and unexpectedly, and may come and go over time. They can include:\\nCompulsions (repetitive behaviors a person feels the urge to do)\\nObsessions (uncontrollable and recurring thoughts)\\nMotor and vocal tics\\nMoodiness, anxiety, or unusual concern about separating from family\\nWhat causes PANS and PANDAS?\\nResearchers don’t know the exact causes of PANS. One theory is that it is triggered by an immune response that leads to inflammation in the\\nbrain. Infections other than strep, immune system disruptions, or environmental factors may cause this reaction. When the immune system\\nmistakenly attacks healthy brain tissue, it can lead to sudden and severe symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive behaviors, tics, anxiety, and\\nmood changes.\\nPANDAS is a specific type of PANS that is believed to be caused by a strep infection. When the immune system fights the infection, it may\\nmistakenly attack healthy areas of the body—including the brain—which can lead to the sudden development of OCD, tics, and other symptoms\\nof PANDAS. Researchers are still looking for the specific antibody that may cause PANDAS.\\nHow common are PANS and PANDAS?\\nThe exact prevalences of PANS and PANDAS are unknown, but these conditions are considered rare.\\nCould an adult develop PANS or PANDAS?\\nPANS and PANDAS typically first appear in childhood, from age 3 to puberty. It’s unlikely, though possible, that an adult could develop one of\\nthese conditions. While adolescents and adults could develop a similar immune-related form of OCD, this possibility has not been thoroughly\\nstudied.\\nWhat are the symptoms of PANS and PANDAS?\\nPANS and PANDAS share many of the same symptoms. Children with PANS or PANDAS may experience:\\nSudden and severe onset of OCD or tic disorder\\nChanges to eating, such as refusing to eat or showing highly selective eating patterns\\nChanges in motor skills, such as changes in handwriting\\nJoint pains\\nRemove from Print\\n07/09/2025, 22:21\\nPANS and PANDAS: Questions and Answers - National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/pandas\\n1/4'),\n",

The list is not comprehensive\\nand does not constitute an endorsement by NIMH.\\nWhat are the treatment options for children with PANS or PANDAS?\\nTreatment for PANS or PANDAS focuses on addressing the underlying cause, managing symptoms, and supporting the immune system. Children\\nand their families can work with their health care provider to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\\nThe best treatment for sudden episodes of PANDAS is to treat the strep infection with antibiotics. Health care providers will order a throat culture\\nto see if strep bacteria are present. If the throat culture is positive, antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat the strep infection and reduce\\nPANDAS symptoms.\\nChildren with PANS or PANDAS may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication, or both\\nto help manage OCD, anxiety, tics, or eating issues.\\nIt’s important to work closely with a health care provider to manage PANS or PANDAS.

Some children recover fully, especially with early intervention, while others may experience recurring episodes or chronic\\nsymptoms.\\nCan PANS and PANDAS be treated with intravenous administration of\\nimmunoglobulins?\\nResearch suggests that intravenous administration of immunoglobulins (IVIG) and similar treatments may improve the symptoms of PANS and\\nPANDAS. However, these treatments can cause side effects including nausea, vomiting, headaches, and dizziness. There is also a risk of infection\\nwith IVIG and similar treatment.\\nBecause of side effects and risks, health care providers only consider IVIG treatment for children with severe PANS or PANDAS.\\nCan antibiotics be used to treat PANS and PANDAS or prevent future symptoms?\\nResearchers at NIMH have been investigating the use of antibiotics to prevent PANDAS. However, there isn’t enough evidence to recommend the\\nlong-term use of antibiotics.\\nHow can I find help?\\nIf you have concerns about your or your child’s health, start by talking to a primary care provider.

Although most \\npeople are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood, the \\nsymptoms can appear earlier in childhood. \\nBipolar disorder is not the same as the typical ups and downs every child \\ngoes through. The mood changes in bipolar disorder are more extreme, often \\nunprovoked, and accompanied by changes in sleep, energy level, and the \\nability to think clearly.\\nChildren with bipolar disorder sometimes feel very happy or “up” and are \\nmuch more energetic and active than usual. This is called a manic episode. \\nChildren with bipolar disorder sometimes feel very sad or “down” and are \\nmuch less active than usual. This is called a depressive episode. Bipolar \\ndisorder is often episodic, but it usually lasts a lifetime. \\nBipolar disorder symptoms can make it hard to perform well in school or get \\nalong with friends and family members. Some children and teens with bipolar \\ndisorder may try to hurt themselves or attempt suicide. Early diagnosis and \\ntreatment can lead to better functioning and well-being over the long term.\\nSigns and symptoms of bipolar disorder may overlap with symptoms of other \\ndisorders that are common in young people, such as attention-deficit/\\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct problems, major depression, and \\nanxiety disorders.'),\n",

Researchers are \\nexamining these differences to learn more about possible causes and \\neffective treatments.\\nWhat are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?\\nMood episodes in bipolar disorder include intense emotions and significant \\nchanges in sleep habits, activity levels, thoughts, or behaviors. Children and \\nteens with bipolar disorder may have manic episodes, depressive episodes, or \\n“mixed” episodes. A mixed episode has both manic and depressive \\nsymptoms.

Most women need treatment to\\nfeel better.\\nDepression has signs and \\nsymptoms to look out for.\\nSadness is only one part of depression. Other common \\nsymptoms include: \\n• Anxiety or irritability\\n• Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or \\nhelplessness\\n• Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities\\n• Fatigue, lack of energy, or feeling slowed down\\n• Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making \\ndecisions\\n• Changes in sleep or appetite\\n• Physical aches or pains that do not have a clear \\nphysical cause \\n• Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts\\nThese symptoms can make it hard to think, work, \\nsleep, study, eat, and enjoy life. Talk to a health care \\nprovider if you experience symptoms most of the day, \\nnearly every day, for at least 2 weeks. Depression \\ndoes not look the same for everyone; some women \\nmay experience many symptoms, and others may \\nexperience only a few. \\nFeeling sad is a normal reaction to difficult times in life. Depression is different—it is \\na mood\\xa0disorder that can affect how a person feels, thinks, and acts.

Depression (also \\ncalled major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is different.  \\nIt can cause severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily \\nactivities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. \\nDepression can affect anyone regardless of age, sex, race or ethnicity, income, culture, \\nor education. Research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and \\npsychological factors play a role in the disorder.\\nWomen are diagnosed with depression more often than men, but men can also be \\ndepressed. Because men may be less likely to recognize, talk about, and seek help for \\ntheir negative feelings, they are at greater risk of their depression symptoms being \\nundiagnosed and undertreated.\\nIn addition, depression can co-occur with other mental disorders or chronic illnesses, \\nsuch as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and chronic pain. Depression can make these \\nconditions worse and vice versa. Sometimes, medications taken for an illness cause \\nside effects that contribute to depression symptoms as well.\\nWhat are the different types of depression?\\nThere are two common types of depression.\\n●Major depression includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of\\nthe time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities.\\n●Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) consists\\nof less severe depression symptoms that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years.\\nOther types of depression include the following.\\n●Seasonal affective disorder comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms\\ntypically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and\\nsummer. For more information, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/SAD.\\n●Depression with symptoms of psychosis is a severe form of depression in which a\\nperson experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations. For\\nmore information, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/psychosis.\\n●Bipolar disorder involves depressive episodes, as well as manic episodes (or less\\nsevere hypomanic episodes) with unusually elevated mood, greater irritability, or\\nincreased activity level. For more information, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/bipolardisorder.\\nAdditional types of depression can occur at specific points in a woman’s life. \\nPregnancy, the postpartum period, the menstrual cycle, and menopause are \\nassociated with physical and hormonal changes that can bring on a depressive \\nepisode in some people.\\n●Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a more severe form of premenstrual\\nsyndrome, or PMS, that occurs in the weeks before menstruation.\\n●Perinatal depression occurs during pregnancy or after childbirth. It is more than\\nthe “baby blues” many new moms experience after giving birth.

They work by \\nchanging how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress. \\nAntidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work, and problems with sleep, appetite, \\nand concentration often improve before mood lifts. Giving a medication a chance to work \\nis important before deciding whether it is right for you.\\nTreatment-resistant depression occurs when a person doesn’t get better after trying at \\nleast two antidepressants. Esketamine is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and \\nDrug Administration (FDA) for treatment-resistant depression. Delivered as a nasal \\nspray in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital, the medication acts rapidly, typically within \\na couple of hours, to relieve depression symptoms.

ASK:\\n“Are you thinking about suicide?” It’s not an easy question to ask, but it can help \\nstart a conversation. Studies show that\\xa0asking people\\xa0if they are suicidal does not \\nincrease suicidal behavior or thoughts. \\n2. BE THERE: \\nListening without judgment is key to learning what the person is thinking and \\nfeeling. Research suggests\\xa0acknowledging and talking about suicide may reduce \\nsuicidal thoughts. \\n3. HELP KEEP THEM SAFE: \\nReducing access to highly lethal items or places can help prevent suicide. Asking \\nthe person if they have a plan and\\xa0making lethal means less available or less \\ndeadly can help the person stay safe when suicidal thoughts arise. \\n4. HELP THEM CONNECT:\\nConnecting the person with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988) and \\nother community resources can give them a safety net when they need it. You can \\nalso help them reach out to a trusted family member, friend, spiritual advisor, or \\nmental health professional. \\n5. FOLLOW UP: \\nStaying in touch with the person after they have experienced a crisis or been \\ndischarged from care can make a difference.\\xa0Studies show\\xa0that supportive, \\nongoing contact can play an important role in suicide prevention.\\nFor more information on suicide prevention:\\nwww.nimh.nih.gov/suicideprevention\\nwww.bethe1to.com  \\nNIMH Identifier No. OM 24-4315\\nRevised 2024')]"
